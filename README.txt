The 4 parts of assignment 2 are in their corresponding folder.
For example, for part 1, the corresponding folder is Comp345A1Part1(???).
The src folder is where all source codes are and is for demo.
 
In this assignment, we experiment different ways to implement the main game loop. 
Part 2: use several free functions in Phase1_2.cpp(determine Player Order and auction Power Plants); 
Part 3: call the member functions in the class of Player(buying Resources and building);
Part 4: create a new class called Phase5 to store the behaviours of Bureaucracy.
This process broadens our design experience in OOP and we are looking forward to doing next assignment to optimize the implementation of the game.
